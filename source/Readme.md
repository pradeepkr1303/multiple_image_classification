## Flower-Images

Hey there,

The script in this folder is used to make an image-classifier using CNN and it can classify if there are more than two classes.


The dataset used here contains images of 10 types of flowers. The number of images in this dataset is quite low, hence the accuracy is okayish.


When using this script please use a lot more images.
